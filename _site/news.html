          SuperTux 0.7.0 BETA 1
        </h3>
        <p>
          <p>The SuperTux Team is ecstatic to announce the first beta release of v0.7.0. This is perhaps one of the largest facelifts to the base game since the introduction of Milestone 2! It features completely redone worlds, new artwork, new music; all from the ground up. As such, it may feel entirely different from the previous game, but the overall premise remains true to its roots.</p>

          <p>Almost every Christmas recently, the SuperTux Team has had an update to release.  However, this year there is unfortunately no update.  It is not because there was no progress made; it’s quite the opposite!  There are so many improvements that have been added, so many more in progress, and so many more that still have to be worked on for the next update, that it was decided best to hold off on an update for this year.</p>
