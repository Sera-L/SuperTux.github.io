    <p>
      Tux and Penny were out having a nice picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
      Suddenly, everything was a blur as Tux was knocked out!
        <br>
      When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay before now lies
      a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!" says the letter. "I have captured your beautiful
      Penny and have taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress is littered
      with my minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven't
      got a chance! -Nolok"
        <br>
      Tux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to save his
      beloved Penny, he begins his journey through the Icy Island and beyond.
